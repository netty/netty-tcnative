# Reporting a security issue

If you think the bug you found is likely to make Netty-based applications vulnerable to
an attack, please do not use our public issue tracker but report it to
[the dedicated private Google Group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/netty-security)
by sending an email to netty-security@googlegroups.com.

This project is maintained by a team of volunteers on a reasonable-effort basis. As
such, please give us 90 days to remediate the vulnerability before public disclosure.
